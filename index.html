			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				Cat hoarders are not just your average "crazy cat lady".  Cat hoarding refers to the compulsive need to collect cats from everywhere and anywhere, with the intention of hugging and squeezing and petting and loving them forever and ever and ever. But with an overwhelming number of cats said hoarder acquires, they often end up neglecting their cats.  Cat hoarders have an intense emotional attachment to their cats and if their cats were to ever be taken away, they will suffer a psychological break-down.
			</p> 
			<p>
				Here at Cat Hoarders Anonymouse, we give hoarders a supportive environment to help them let go of their addiction to cats.  We've adapted the twelve-step program to help our members on the road to recovery.  Come join us in the house of L. Ron Hubbard.
