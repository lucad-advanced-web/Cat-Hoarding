<h4>
	What is Cat Hoarding?
</h4>
	<p>
	Cat hoarding occurs when someone collects more cats than they are about to care for, usually resulting in social withdrawal and a deteriorated living space.

<h4>
Symptoms
</h4>
<p>
How to tell if you're a cat hoarder:
<ul>
	<li>You commonly refer to pets as your children.</li>
	<li>The cats in your care are not in good health.</li>
	<li>You have a list of people you would like to neuter.</li>
	<li>Your guests sit on the floor because the cat is taking a nap on the sofa.</li>
	<li>You are becoming less capable of maintaining human relationships.</li>
	<li>You absentmindedly scratch people under the chin.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h4>
Prevention Tips
</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Neuter your cats.</li>
	<li>Do not drive past the animal shelter; doing so will increase temptation.</li>
	<li>Remember: Happiness is <strong>not</strong> having what 
	</strong>you want, it's wanting what you have.</strong></li>
	<li>Carry a picture of your own cat with you (either on your phone or in your wallet) so when you feel the urge to take home that cute stray, look at the picture and remember that Sir Chester Fuzzington II deserves all your love and attention.</li>
	<li>You wouldn't want your husband to bring home multiple wives (unless you're a mormon), so why would you subject your cat to the same thing? (unless your cat is also mormon)</li>
	<li>Stop going on the internet.</li>

</ul>
